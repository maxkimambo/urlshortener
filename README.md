# Url Shortener (Kissly)
UrlShortener Proof of Concept 

Kissly started out of curiosity of how different techniques that could be used to shorten urls

This is a naive implementation of this idea, I wanted to know how much effort it would take to create one. 
Some inspiration was taken from the following articles. 
[1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening
